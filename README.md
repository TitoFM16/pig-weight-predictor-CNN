# pig-weight-predictor-CNN

A python program capable of identify and predict the average weight of pigs
analyzed in frames of videos made with tensorflow to train a convolutional 
neural network model and opencv to analyze every frame with the trained model,
also done some regression work with pigs contourns between the growth period to 
predict the pigs weight based on it contourn's area.
